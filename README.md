I'm a dev based on Valencia, Spain, with a passion for solving problems. As I continue on my journey of self-improvement and learning, I've been fortunate enough to co-found and work on some fascinating projects.

- I founded **[Lightstand](https://lightstand.io/)**, a christian startup focused on building software for the glory of God 🙌.
- I worked on some cool personal projects such as:
  - **[Modulab](https://github.com/pedrogardim/modulab)** 🎛️: A modular playground for web components.
  - **[Musabeat](https://github.com/pedrogardim/musabeat)** 🎶: A web DAW (Digital Audio Workstation).
<!--
- and created some projects as:
  **[GameboyJS](https://github.com/pedrogardim/modulab)** : A iteractive gameboy .
